::: notes
As graduate students we are told that functionalism is bad

-   On logical grounds: circular reasoning
-   On political grounds: conservative

but functionalist explanations are still widely used.

\*\* Extra \*\*

Status hierarchies make group efforts more **efficient** by managing disagreements, redirecting competitive interests, and coordinating actions into a joint effort.

This last quote by Eduardo Bonilla is key in the literature on racism, in that many argue you cannot understand race as a social construction unless you also understand the purpose it serves, its function.

This is not the structural-functionalism of Talcott Parsons, nor the type of framework that sees society as a living organism with component parts that perform unique tasks that contribute to the survival and reproduction of the whole.

::: notes
1.  It is this idea that "society" or "capitalism" are like organisms that have "goals" or "needs" and that the component parts of society (whatever that is) are like organs.

    Abstract macro-entities with "needs" whose component parts have self-maintenance functions.

2.  Not as a substantive theory about society!

    You can call this a meta-theory or a methodological frame of reference...

There is an affinity here.

Sure sounds like the kind of world problem-solving sociologists *would* like to live in.

I do not endorse this definition of functionalism.

Granovetter was very skeptical that this kind of explanation would actually amount to something defensible.

:::

## Functionalist Explanations are Teleological

::: {style="border-bottom: 1px solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-top: 1em;"}
Teleology is the study of [purpose]{.smallcaps} or end-[goals]{.smallcaps}.
:::

::: {.fragment style="padding-top: 0.5em;"}
We explain the existence and shape of *X* by making reference to its [purpose]{.smallcaps}

:::

::: incremental
1.  No definition of [function]{.smallcaps}

    ::: auth-reference
    role-functions and proper functions
    :::

2.  Conflates [function]{.smallcaps}-explanations and [goal]{.smallcaps}-explanations
:::

::: notes
Functionalism and teleology. These are two words with a lot of baggage. Lets unpack them.

1.  These explanations have a bad reputation. Regarded as mysterious and problematic since they seem to imply that something in the future can reach back in time and affect the past.

    It feels like conspiracy theory.

    It is a mistake to infer the origins of some phenomenon by examining its consequences rather than the actual processes that brought it about.

2.  A very abstract way of grounding purpose in scientific terms. Of demystifying the problem of backwards causation. Proliferation of causal diagrams in which "functional" social phenomena resemble the inner-workings of house thermostats and homing torpedos... directed towards some kind of built-in goal.

    Negative feedback. Homeostatic variables. And "control" over perturbations.

3.  Seemingly abandoned this template.

    1.  No definition of function.

    2.  You see... goals and functions are often used interchangeably with the word "purpose." But they are not the same!

        That chair has a function, but it does not have goals.

\*\* Extra \*\*

“*seeing* is customarily said to be a function of eyes, rather than their goal; and *escape from a predator* is said to be the goal of a hare’s flight, rather than its function.”

"By a functional explanation we mean one in which the *consequences* of some behavior or social arrangement are essential elements of the *causes* of that behavior" [@stinchcombe1968, 80].

Stinchcombe describes various causal loops, ranging from differential reproduction via some kind of natural selection, learning via trial-and-error, individual and collective planning, and many more. “Each of these common processes select out and reinforce behavior or social structures according to their consequences."
:::

# Functions {background-color="#4C837B"}

::: notes
**What functions are not.**

1.  Mathematical functions that specify relationships between variables.
2.  Effects, outcomes, consequences
3.  Beneficial effects, beneficial outcomes, beneficial consequences.

Note. I did not come up with any of the terms I will introduce in this section. These are common distinctions in the philosophical literature.
:::

## [Proper Functions]{.smallcaps} (or "Selected Effects")

::: {style="border-bottom: 1px solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-top: 1em;"}

:::

::: notes
All proper functions are historical.

Selection process: certain features of organizations proliferate

*X*: a trait, a belief, a behavioral disposition, a ritual, an artifact, an organization, a rule, ...

If you qualify the effect as "useful" then we get the notion of an *adaptation.*

\*\* Extra \*\*

Note. Proper functions are not grounded in human intention or design. That may play *some* role, but it's not the main one. The world is filled with unanticipated consequences.
:::

## [Role-Functions]{.smallcaps}

::: {style="border-bottom: 1px solid; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"}
How-does-it-work question (a-historical)

*The role-function of X is its contribution to some higher-level phenomena.*
:::

![](images/fingerprints.png){width="100%"}
:::
:::

::: notes
The thing-to-explained is not the function bearer, it is not X.

The thing-to-be-explained is some complex capacity of a "system."

Some "system" is explained in terms of the *organized activities of its component parts.*

Air-traffic system's capacity to land planes safely.

Law-enforcement organization's capacity to surveil.

Example:

-   Fingerprints contribute to the overall surveillance capacity of law-enforcement organizations but only insofar as these organizations have an infrastructure that collects, stores, and retrieves the information encoded in them.

-   The role-function of fingerprints cannot be understood in isolation, without reference to the role-functions of other interacting parts.

-   This “function” of fingerprints in this chosen “system” does not have a history of selection.

-   Fingerprints do not exist for the sake of surveillance systems, and there is obviously no causal feedback loop connecting surveillance to the maintenance or reproduction of fingerprints.

If we think of these capacities as "goals", then these role-functions are synonymous with goal-contributions.
:::

# Goals and Goal-Directed Behavior {background-color="#4C837B"}

::: notes
People and other organisms have goals. They may be ascribed role-functions in the context of some division of labor, but they do not have proper functions.

A knife may be described as having various role-functions, but it will never have goals.
:::

## [Goal]{.smallcaps}-Directed Behavior

::: {style="padding-top: 1em;"}
Includes (1) the *conscious* pursuit of [goals]{.smallcaps} and (2) non-deliberate behavior.
:::

::: {.fragment style="padding-top: 1em;"}
Behavioral markers:

-   [Persistence]{.smallcaps}

    ::: auth-reference
    the capacity for error correction, returning to some trajectory following perturbations
    :::

-   [Plasticity]{.smallcaps}

    ::: auth-reference
    the capacity for finding a particular trajectory from a wide range of starting points
    :::
:::

::: fragment
*What is the source of persistence and plasticity?*
:::

::: notes
::: {.fragment style="padding-top: 1em;"}
It is important to keep goals and goal-directed behavior apart.

Behavioral markers help make sense of the distinction between professed and operational goals.

Consider Karl Marx’s famous discussion of the "goals or "interests" of the individual capitalist as being relatively inconsequential since ultimately it is capitalist competition that will drive his behavior.

The thing-to-be-explained is different. It shifted levels! Functions can be the outcome of a goal-directed process.
:::
:::

## [Goals]{.smallcaps}

::: {style="padding-top: 1em;"}
Individuals intentionally pursuing their "wants" and "needs."
:::

::: incremental
-   Rational Choice Theory

    ::: auth-reference
    micro-economic functionalism
    :::

-   Max Weber's cultural sociology

    ::: auth-reference
    motives, values

::: fragment
When is it useful to describe collectivities as as having "[goals]{.smallcaps}" of their own?

::: auth-reference
Mechanisms behind "functional integration" or "unity of purpose."
:::
:::

::: notes
There is nothing mysterious about teleological explanations when they invoke "needs" and "wants" as a long as it's grounded in *people.*

Earlier I said that functionalism is associated with an abstract organicism framework. One of the biggest problems with Parsonian structural-functionalism is that it was too liberal in its adjudication of "goals" and "needs" to abstract macro-entities. Think "society" or "capitalism."

## When [Formal Rationality]{.smallcaps} Works

<div>

**Authoritative abstractions (rationalized "tools"):**

::: incremental

-   Processed information

    ::: auth-reference
    blueprints, statistical summaries, written reports, etc.
    :::
:::

</div>

::: fragment
**Three desiderata:**

-   Cognitive Adequacy

-   Communicability

-   Trajectory of Improvement
:::

:::

</aside>

::: notes
Together, these are a reliable indicators that formality is adaptive, functional.

1.  The abstraction provides an adequate representation of the underlying problem, otherwise it will not be a useful guide to action. This usually means that a blueprint has the right amount of detail; that rules and categories are unambiguous; data is measured without error; and so on.

2.  Communicability means that information must be transparent and reach relevant decision-makers in a timely and reliable fashion. Information doesn't deteriorate.

3.  Organizations must have feedback systems that allow for self-correction in response to changing realities and, thus, lead to improvement over time.

    Important mistakes must be corrected, ambiguities must be resolved, new rules have to be introduced, old rules have to be eliminated, technologies must be updated regularly, and so on. This is the only way for formalities to remain adequate and communicable.

\*\* Extra \*\*

Organizations have limited resources and so they typically weigh the costs and benefits of acquiring extra information. Often, they must sacrifice accuracy in exchange for efficiency.

And since communication is always marked by some degree of ambiguity—a “variance in meaning”—it is normal for organizations to be staffed by professionals with a specialized language (or “formalized linguistic communities”).

Discretion is unavoidable. The world keeps changing. It is riddled with unanticipated situations.

Discretion. Knowing how to bend and adjust rules.

Deference. Who gets to decide, who gets to resolve ambiguities.

"Because the rules had to be inflexible in order to absorb personal accountability, they were unable to react to situations that hadn’t been anticipated. It was to be expected that anomalies and inconsistencies would build up over time, eventually causing the system to fail catastrophically—rather like a self-driving car handing back control to the owner at the worst possible moment."
